# The Statistics Client

The statistics client can be accessed at
[localhost:3000/stats](localhost:3000) It allows. users to track usage of
the system. Users will be able to view which subjects are the most asked
per semester, week, or day. The data is pre-aggregated in a database,
which means to record statistics the database must be running. The rest of
the system will function, even it the database is not running.
