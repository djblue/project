# The Request Client

The request client can be found at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

To be able to access the request client, you must indicate your table
number (selectable through a drop down) when you first try to access the
client and provide a password. The password will be static and can by
configured when the system is setup.

After access is granted, the request client allows students to insert up
to 3 questions into the queue. After a question is asked by going through
a basic menu, it appears to the right. Questions can be canceled by the
student at any time. As soon as the question is asked, it appears
immediately on the [Question Queue Client](./queue.md). Tutors can confirm
that a question has been completed by sliding the question to the right.
